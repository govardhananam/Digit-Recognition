# Handwritten Digit recognition.
Run it on google collab or juptyr
save the model using tensorflowjs
Deploy the model. Run the Html file on the local server to test the deployed model.

This dataset used is MNIST digit datset.

# If the python notebook doesn't load

Try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.

Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
Paste the link to your notebook, (e.g. "https://github.com/govardhananam/Attack-Classes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/KDDCup.ipynb") there and then you get "http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github.com/govardhananam/Attack-Classes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/KDDCup.ipynb"
This site nbviewer works independently of github.

If some notebook rendered in nbviewer appears different from rendered in github, then append "?flush_cache=true" to the end of the nbviewer version url to force it to rerender.
e.g.
http://github.com/govardhananam/Attack-Classes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/KDDCup.ipynb
becomes
http://github.com/govardhananam/Attack-Classes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/KDDCup.ipynb?flush_cache=true
